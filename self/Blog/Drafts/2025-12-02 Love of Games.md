I consider myself what we call today a "gamer."

Though I feel like a lot of things that has become a kind of "thing you can be" like how you can "be a punk" if you buy the right clothes.

Of course you can Be A Punk and then those are the clothes you wear. Telling the difference is difficult. That is true for our own opinions of ourselves as well. 

Anyway...

I _do think_ I am a gamer and not just wearing studs. I just...don't know what makes me think that. Sometimes when I talk to really nerdy gamers I feel a need to interject that I really like Call Of Duty. At the same time if we are in the casual realm talking about how great Call Of Duty is (and really it quite good) I will feel the need to remind everyone that no, Factorio [[all time most played game]].

I definitely think this _breadth_ of games gives me a little more credit. Kind of like how [Peter Travers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Travers) can recognize game for game, and give equally high scores to [State & Main](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120202/) and [3 Billboards](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5027774/). 

# So What is the Best Game of All Time?

Or maybe?
