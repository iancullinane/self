How most of us think of and perceive time is all wrong. I would even argue that as individuals (Or groups of individuals, or types of individuals...) we experience time differently. We do however experience _now_ in equal capacity. Our most accessible piece of data has become the 'second.' This is also the least useful (and ironically the only real) unit of time. 

Most people are unaware that this kind of minute measurement of time, is relatively recent. Below I have tried to list _kinds_ of time from modern to ancient and I encourage you to stop and analyze the recurrent theme as we move _through_ time as a function.




%% The second (hereafter capitalized) has also become the dominating unit of reality, as we most inconveniently carry around devices capable of being measured by (and are consistently measured by) what we do with seconds.

 In reality, people occupy multiple kinds of time constantly. Altogether they create 'now.' I

# Kinds of time

## Ancient Time

These are actually the kinds of time that matter most. Our bodies and minds are actually attuned to them, in the same way that a item in D&D may need attunement. We _probably_ live on lunar time in a way we don't realize. I kind of don't  believe something as massive as the moon _can't_ have some kind of effect.

**Solar Time**
Day and night, the endless cycle. I consider this similarly to how I think of seconds. Crucially important but easy to get lost in it.

**Mornings & Afternoon**
This is probably the most important time. It is both not too large and not too small. It always feels like now and not some foreign concept. It is distinct from **Solar Time** in that it divides the time we are awake. This is not a universal experience either. Inuit people would have extremely long "solar days" but it would still require a day and night cycle to account for sleep. 

**Lunar Time**

This is the one I have been ignoring most of my life.  Often bucketed under Astrology, I suspect there can be no doubt the phases of the moon affect us. At least in our perceptions and impressions. In late 2025 I started tracking the phases of the moon loosely with my mood. We will see how it shakes out.

**Orbital time**
This is year. Like the second and the Solar Time, it doesn't really help. It is just a yard stick.

**Seasonal time**
Another of the great wheels of time. This is time we have been feeling for billions of years. I think this is the best time to follow after **morning and afternoon** as it has real rhythm and change. Seasonal time is interesting as well because not everything experiences it the same. Like M&A time where you lie on the equator will determine how you live it. In New England we have 4 distinct seasons (Autumn, Winter, Road Rage, and Summer). In San Fransico however winter was very different, and in Los Angeles it did not exist. However the seasons still passed, and I think most of all this was felt in the length of the days. 

## Antiquated Time

**Agricultrual Time**

For a long time all improvements on how we live with time focused on calendars. Early such calendars were generally [Lunisolar](![[Pasted image 20251230093930.png]]) and thus tied to the moon. I find this fascinating as out current calendars essentially ignore the moon, though are clearly based on how the moon wobble. 12 Lunar months are roughly 354 days which does not account for orbital time of 365 days. Through [intercalation] we can make this difference up. Islamic calendars are purely lunar and do not account for this wobble.
