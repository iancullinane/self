I took a long walk in the rain. Very long. I don't know how many times I criss-crossed Boston Common. I found my way up and down Newbury. At the State House steps. In alleys. Often lost but always in the right direction.

At first I wore my hood. I kept it pulled so my glasses did not form droplets. Eventually, too wet to make a difference, I pulled it back around me neck. With no shelter on my face my glasses found home in a pocket.

I did at some point stop taking pictures. I hoped I would be able to use words to describe the feeling. But I can't.

I can tell you every breath felt new. That eventually the pain and tiredness in my lets did not matter and how that was the point. I could describe the mix of colors, magnified now by allowing the rain to wash over my eyes and give me new sight.

Or I keep them to myself. It was just for me.
