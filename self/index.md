Experienced software and platform engineer. I have worn a lot of hats from cloud engineering, SRE and DevOps, feature development for a "Top 10" 4X Strategy Mobile Game, release engineering, automation, ChatOps (❤️), tools development, web development and more. I love writing readable an maintainable software. I see software as a craft and bring that attitude to my work. Beyond my technical experience, I am a proven mentor and teacher. I am constantly growing and enjoy helping others do the same. I have a background outside of tech which helps me see the holistic whole of a product or organization. Not just the tech. Looking for any opportunity to challenge me, particularly in organizations looking to move to the cloud and embrace DevOps and SRE practices.
