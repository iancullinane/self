# Personal Philosophy

>Play

In my professional life where I lead a team of Software Engineers, I have found the practice of [Vision Statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_statement) to be incredibly valuable.

I believe that as individuals we often fail to define these kinds of beacons for ourselves. Ideas that can anchor you to your values.  This lack of clarity can make life feel aimless and void. 

My vision is not long and does not require much thought as play is not in the realm of thought or goals or anything. Play is life and the default state of the universe, is to be playful. 

I find my worries and stress and all the discomfort those things can bring melt in the dizzying power of remembering to play. In remembering that when one begins to dance you don't have a goal of where in the room your feet will stop. You only dance to experience the room. Dancing is becoming unified in the patterns of a song.

Life is play. Remember to sing and dance.
